# Nasa Event Tracker

## Purpose
This web app takes in data from NASA's API, correlates the location, and uses google maps to mark an event appropriate Icon at that location. You can also click on the
marker and it will display event information.

## Process
This app was built using React.js, HTML5 and CSS3. It utilized APIs from NASA and Google.

## Possible Improvements
This app obviously is for development purposes only, but I would eventually want to use a full map instead of the development. Multiple geographic coordinates are given for
one tropical storm, I would like to utilize this to plot a path and display that on the map. These improvements would make the app a better product, along with some tweaking
on visuals and possibly some more functionability.
